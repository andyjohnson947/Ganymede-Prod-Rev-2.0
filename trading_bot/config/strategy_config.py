# The fix prevents recovery orders from spawning more recovery (300 trade bug fixed)

# =============================================================================
# GRID PARAMETERS (PYRAMID OVERLAPPING STRATEGY)
# =============================================================================
# Grid creates OVERLAPPING positions in same direction when in profit
# Example: BUY @ 1.1000 -> +10 pips -> Open Grid 1: BUY @ 1.1010
#                       -> +20 pips -> Open Grid 2: BUY @ 1.1020

#
# NOTE: Per-instrument grid settings (grid_spacing_pips, max_grid_levels) are

# Recovery Stack Drawdown Protection
# ALIGNED: Now uses same -$30/-$20 limits as Per-Stack Stop Loss (see below)

# ADX HARD STOP PROTECTION (TOGGLE FOR ML-RECOMMENDED APPROACH)
# =============================================================================
# ML Analysis shows 65.9% better performance with ADX hard stops vs recovery
# When enabled: ADX > 30 triggers -50 pip hard SL and blocks ALL recovery
# When disabled: Current recovery system (DCA/Hedge) operates normally
#
# See analysis: ml_system/outputs/adx_vs_recovery_comparison.json

# BROKER TIMEZONE CONFIGURATION
# =============================================================================

# MT5 brokers use different server timezones. Set your broker's GMT offset here.

#
# Common broker timezones:
#   0  = GMT/UTC (rare, used by some brokers)
#   +2 = GMT+2 (EET - most European brokers in winter)
#   +3 = GMT+3 (EET summer / some brokers use this year-round)
#   -4 = GMT-4 (EDT - some US brokers in summer)
#   -5 = GMT-5 (EST - some US brokers in winter)
#
# HOW TO FIND YOUR BROKER'S OFFSET:
# 1. Check current GMT time: https://time.is/GMT
# 2. Check your MT5 terminal time (bottom right corner)
# 3. Calculate: MT5 time - GMT time = your offset
#    Example: MT5 shows 14:00, GMT is 12:00 -> offset is +2
#
# IMPORTANT: All trading hours in this config are in GMT/UTC.
# The bot will automatically convert broker time to GMT using this offset.
